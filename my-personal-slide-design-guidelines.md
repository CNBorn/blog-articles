Title: My Personal Slide Design Guidelines
Tags: slide, design
Slug: my-personal-slide-design-guidelines

Nowadays, People tend to express their ideas with 100-page slides containing various transition effects and fade-in/out elements to 'emphasis' their highlights. After experiencing that many 'slide exhibition' instead of presentation, I want to show some of my guidelines to some fresh slide-makers, to greatly diminish these horrible situations.

0. General Guidelines: Alignments

    One of the essential point that everyone should take much more efforts on this. Better alignments means better readibility and clearaty. Keynote Alignment Assistance is your good friend, few other softwares in the same category can compete KeyNote with this feature.
    For more information on this subject, I would highly recommend everyone reference to "The Non-Designer's Design Book".
    
1. No (transition) effects at all

    Seldom people know how to make effects in their slides properly function while not to disturb the audience. Under these cercumstances I would rather to work without these fancy effects which eliminates distractions of audiences, makes them focus on content.
    
2. Less information on one slide

    Pretend that all your audiences can not quickly understand what you're talking about. Less information make them read, grasp your idea very quickly from one slide then focus on your speaking, rather than try to read through quite amount of texts.

3. Clearly indicates progress

    Pretend your audiences have a quite short-memory, When you show them step-2, You'd better show theme where step-1 was at. Clearility is the king.

4. One primary object only in one slide.

    More slide doesn't cost that much.

5. Fonts

    No fancy fonts. The fewer fonts are used in your slides, the better result will become.
