I had a happy chinese new year at Fujian last month. Many of my friends are curious of what it looks like, I'll put some of my photos here to give you a glimpse of it.

JianOu (second half pronounces in English is more like Oh) is [a city in Fujian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jianou). Fujian province got its name derived from both Fuzhou(the current capital city of Fujian province) and JianOu.
