I had a happy chinese new year at Fujian last month. Many of my friends are curious of what it looks like, I'll put some of my photos here to give you a glimpse of it.

JianOu (second half pronounces in English is more like Oh) is one of the old capital cities of some southern regime in Chinese history. Fujian province got its name derived from both Fuzhou(the current capital city of Fujian province) and JianOu.

Photos of GuangXiaoSi, a buddist temple, one of the largest temple in Jianou. A lot of people comes here during new year holiday, They light a lot of fireworks in front of the temple in order to wish a pleasent year.

The Tea Cup photo is taken during a private collection show of this temple. The Cup itself is made of a lost technic which origins from Fujian but now lost. Craftsman in both China and Japan are trying to regain this precious feat called 'JianZhan'(Jian Style), which made the supernova alike texture style on the cup.
