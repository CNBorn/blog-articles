My name is Tyler Xing. I used to work at [Douban Inc](http://www.douban.com) as tech leader and software engineer.

I enjoy programming and still feel excited in  learning new stuff. I believe in and honor the power of creation. Creating software or product is my way to make people's life better. I'm also passionate about sharing novelty & creative ideas among several events, mostly on the event I co-organized: [Beijing OpenParty](http://www.beijing-open-party.org).

This is my blog and I write in both [English](http://cnborn.net/blog/lang/en/) and [Chinese](http://cnborn.net/blog/lang/zh/). You can reach me at [Twitter](http://twitter.com/CNBorn), [Github](https://github.com/CNBorn) and also by email(cnborn at gmail dot com).
