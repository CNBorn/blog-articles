My name is Tyler Xing. This is my blog, you can reach me at [Twitter](http://twitter.com/CNBorn), [Github](https://github.com/CNBorn) and also by email(cnborn at gmail dot com). 

I work at Douban Inc as a tech leader and software engineer. [Douban.com](http://www.douban.com) is the largest interest based social network in China. I mostly work in Python & Android(Java)  and still learning new things on the way.

I believe in and honor the power of creation, creating software or product is my way to make people's life better. I'm also passionate about sharing novelty & creative ideas among several events, mostly on the event I co-organized: [Beijing OpenParty](http://www.beijing-open-party.org).

My wife and I are both constant travelers, I logged some of our trips under the [travel](http://cnborn.net/blog/category/Traveling/) category. While we are not on the road, watching movies, reading/bookstore digging and listening to classical music will fill in our time.
